You say that you love rain,
If by Life You Were Deceived
but you open your umbrella when it rains...
Aleksandr Pushkin

You say that you love the sun,
but you find a shadow spot when the sun shines...
Merry days will come, believe.


If by life you were deceived,
You say that you love the wind,
Don't be dismal,don't be wild!
but you close your windows when wind blows...
This is why I am afraid;
In the day of grief, be mild .
You say that you love me too...
Present is dejected here;
